=head1 PROPERTIES

=head2 C<< categorisedActors >>

The actors to add to the project role.

Add groups using:

 *  `atlassian-group-role-actor` and a list of group names.
 *  `atlassian-group-role-actor-id` and a list of group IDs.

As a group's name can change, use of `atlassian-group-role-actor-id` is recommended. For example, `"atlassian-group-role-actor-id":["eef79f81-0b89-4fca-a736-4be531a10869","77f6ab39-e755-4570-a6ae-2d7a8df0bcb8"]`.

Add users using `atlassian-user-role-actor` and a list of account IDs. For example, `"atlassian-user-role-actor":["12345678-9abc-def1-2345-6789abcdef12", "abcdef12-3456-789a-bcde-f123456789ab"]`.
