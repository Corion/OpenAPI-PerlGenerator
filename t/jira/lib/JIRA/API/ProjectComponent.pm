sub as_hash( $self ) {
    return { $self->%* }

=head1 PROPERTIES

=head2 C<< assignee >>

The details of the user associated with `assigneeType`, if any. See `realAssignee` for details of the user assigned to issues created with this component.

=cut

has 'assignee' => (
    is       => 'ro',
);

=head2 C<< assigneeType >>

The nominal user type used to determine the assignee for issues created with this component. See `realAssigneeType` for details on how the type of the user, and hence the user, assigned to issues is determined. Can take the following values:

 *  `PROJECT_LEAD` the assignee to any issues created with this component is nominally the lead for the project the component is in.
 *  `COMPONENT_LEAD` the assignee to any issues created with this component is nominally the lead for the component.
 *  `UNASSIGNED` an assignee is not set for issues created with this component.
 *  `PROJECT_DEFAULT` the assignee to any issues created with this component is nominally the default assignee for the project that the component is in.

Default value: `PROJECT_DEFAULT`.  
Optional when creating or updating a component.

=cut

has 'assigneeType' => (
    is       => 'ro',
    isa      => Enum[
        "PROJECT_DEFAULT",
        "COMPONENT_LEAD",
        "PROJECT_LEAD",
        "UNASSIGNED",
    ],
);

=head2 C<< description >>

The description for the component. Optional when creating or updating a component.

=cut

has 'description' => (
    is       => 'ro',
    isa      => Str,

=head2 C<< id >>

The unique identifier for the component.

=cut

has 'id' => (
    is       => 'ro',
    isa      => Str,
);

=head2 C<< isAssigneeTypeValid >>

Whether a user is associated with `assigneeType`. For example, if the `assigneeType` is set to `COMPONENT_LEAD` but the component lead is not set, then `false` is returned.

=cut

has 'isAssigneeTypeValid' => (
    is       => 'ro',
);

The user details for the component's lead user.

=cut

has 'lead' => (
    is       => 'ro',

=cut

has 'leadAccountId' => (
    is       => 'ro',
    isa      => Str,
